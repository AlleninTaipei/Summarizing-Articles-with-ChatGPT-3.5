# Nvidia’s Jensen Huang: The incredible future of AI

* [Source:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEg8cOx7UZk&t=2915s) *Keynote by NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang at 2024 SIEPR Economic Summit*
* *A message for the world about artificial intelligence: You ain’t seen nothing yet.*
* *For all of you Stanford students, he said, “I wish upon you ample doses of pain and suffering.*

## A conversation between John Chauvin and Jensen Huang

* Jensen Huang provided background on his personal story as an immigrant and NVIDIA's founding.
* He discussed NVIDIA's role in accelerated computing and AI, explaining how they've dramatically reduced the cost of AI computing.
* Huang talked about the future of AI, including multimodal models, improved reasoning capabilities, and potential timelines for artificial general intelligence (AGI).
* He gave insights into AI's role in drug discovery and biology, suggesting AI will help understand the "meaning" of biological data.
* Huang offered advice to aspiring entrepreneurs, emphasizing the importance of resilience and character over just intelligence.
* He discussed NVIDIA's company culture and management style.
* Huang addressed questions about semiconductor manufacturing capacity needs for AI growth.
* He clarified earlier comments about coding, suggesting that while traditional coding may become less critical, "prompt engineering" will be an important skill.
* Huang discussed geopolitical risks and the concept of "Sovereign AI" for different countries.

## Key Point

|AI's Impact on Computing and Work|AI is transforming computing from retrieval-based to generative.|
|-|-|
||In the future, most content will be AI-generated rather than pre-recorded.This shift will dramatically change how we interact with computers and information.|
|**Skills for the AI Era**|**While coding skills remain valuable, "prompt engineering" will become increasingly important.**|
||The ability to effectively communicate with AI systems in natural language will be a crucial skill. This change could democratize technology, allowing more people to leverage AI without traditional programming skills.|
|**AI in Various Industries**|**AI's potential in drug discovery and biology, suggesting AI will help understand the "meaning" of biological data.**|
||This implies AI will have far-reaching impacts across multiple sectors, not just tech.|
|**Educational and Career Implications**|**Students should focus on developing adaptability and problem-solving skills.**|
||The importance of resilience and character development, suggesting these traits will be valuable in the AI era. He encouraged Stanford students to embrace challenges and "pain and suffering" as character-building experiences.|
|**Supply Chain and Manufacturing**|**AI is likely to significantly impact supply chain management and manufacturing processes.**|
||Using AI for tasks like creating build plans and bills of materials, suggesting increased automation in these areas.|
|**Geopolitical Considerations**|**"Sovereign AI," where countries aim to control their own AI capabilities.**|
||This trend could impact global supply chains and technology transfer.|
|**Job Market Changes**|**While some traditional roles may be automated, new opportunities will emerge in AI-related fields.**|
||AI could close the "technology divide," potentially creating more opportunities for a broader range of people.|
|**Continuous Learning and Adaptation**|**The rapid pace of AI development means that continuous learning will be crucial.**|
||Professionals in all fields should stay informed about AI advancements and be prepared to adapt their skills.|
|**Ethical and Safety Considerations**|**As AI becomes more powerful, there's an increased focus on AI safety and ethics.**|
||This could create new roles and responsibilities in various industries.|
|**Business Opportunities**|**The AI revolution is creating opportunities for new businesses and the transformation of existing ones.**|
||Those who can effectively leverage AI technologies will have a significant advantage.|

## NVIDIA's advantage

|beside CUDA, Tensor-Core and NVLink||
|-|-|
|**Competition in AI Chip Market: 100% of today's inferencing is done on NVIDIA GPUs.**|**1. While inference might seem easier than training, it's actually quite challenging.**<br>**2. Inference requires high response times.**<br>**3. The real challenge is the "install base" problem - having a platform that's widely available and compatible.**|
|**NVIDIA's advantage**|**Their accelerated computing platform is ubiquitous, allowing applications to run "everywhere."**|
||This widespread compatibility is a result of years of work and patience.|
|**On potential "good enough" competitors**|**NVIDIA faces competition not just from other companies, but also from their own customers.**|
||**NVIDIA's advantage isn't just in chip performance, but in the total cost of operations (TCO).** According to Jensen, NVIDIA's TCO is so good that "even when the competitor's chips are free, it's not cheap enough."|
|**On customization for customers**|**Jensen indicated openness to customizing solutions for customers.**|
||The high costs and complexity involved in chip development, any customization needs to leverage NVIDIA's existing ecosystem to be feasible.|
