# A conversation with NVIDIAâ€™s Jensen Huang

* [Source:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Pfa8kPjUio)*Jensen Huang, Founder, President and CEO of NVIDIA joins Stripe Cofounder and CEO Patrick Collison for a fireside chat on leadership in the age of AI.*

## Leadership philosophy, approach to innovation, views on the trajectory and impact of AI technology

* Jensen discussed his leadership style at NVIDIA, including having 60 direct reports and avoiding one-on-one meetings in favor of group meetings where everyone has access to the same information.
* He talked about pursuing "zero billion dollar markets" - markets that don't exist yet but could be huge if created. This requires believing strongly in an idea even when it's not successful initially, like CUDA which took about 10 years to pay off.
* On AI, Jensen believes we're entering a new "industrial revolution" where data centers will produce "tokens" (floating point numbers representing intelligence) at massive scale. He thinks this will transform many industries.
* He views progress in AI capabilities as exponential, with accuracy doubling yearly. He expects models to keep improving significantly.
* Jensen sees open source models like Meta's LLaMA as very important for democratizing access to AI across industries.
* On AGI, he said if defined by current benchmarks it could arrive within 5 years, but acknowledged that may not match most people's definition.
* He strongly advises all businesses to aggressively adopt AI or risk falling behind competitors who do.
* NVIDIA is integrating AI throughout its own operations in chip design, software development, bug tracking, etc.
* Jensen believes companies will need to train their own domain-specific AI models for critical use cases, even as general models improve.

## Deep commitment and understanding

* Jensen briefly discussed his family connection to Lisa Su, CEO of AMD, saying they didn't grow up together but acknowledging her extraordinary career.
* On changes in Silicon Valley culture since the early 90s, Jensen noted that it's now more common and accepted for very young people to be CEOs and founders, contrasting with the more formal, suit-wearing executives of the past.
* They discussed NVIDIA's relatively small employee count (28,000) compared to other tech giants with similar market caps. Jensen emphasized the importance of tenure and craft in achieving excellence, rather than just operational processes.
* Jensen spoke about the importance of "loving care" in creating extraordinary products and organizations, saying some things can't be specified in processes or emails but require deep commitment and understanding.
* They discussed the value of craft and beauty in products, even when customers don't explicitly ask for it. 
* Jensen argued that customers recognize and appreciate these qualities even if they don't articulate them.
* Jensen emphasized the importance of simplicity and elegance in products, using [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) as an example of a service that solves problems efficiently without overburdening users.
* He stressed the value of long-tenured teams who understand the company's "encoded magic" and can build upon past experiences to create better products.
* Jensen concluded by praising Stripe's achievements with a relatively small team, supporting a large ecosystem and economy.
