# Everybody in the World is Now a Programmer

* [Source:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Pm2xEViNIo) *A Conversation with the Founder of NVIDIA: Who Will Shape the Future of AI?*

|Key Points|Description|
|-|-|
|Accelerated Computing and AI|We're at the beginning of a new Industrial Revolution centered on AI.
||There's a transition from general-purpose computing to accelerated computing, which is more energy-efficient and cost-effective.|
||NVIDIA has advanced computing and AI by 1 million times in the last 10 years.|
|Democratization of AI|NVIDIA has helped democratize high-performance computing by making it accessible to researchers worldwide.|
||**Open-source models like LLaMA 2, Falcon, and others have been crucial in activating AI researchers globally.**|
|Sovereign AI|Every country needs to own the production of its own intelligence.|
||Countries should build their own AI infrastructure and create their own large language models.|
|AI Infrastructure|Building AI infrastructure is crucial for countries wanting to leverage AI. It's not as costly or difficult as it might seem.|
|AI Applications|AI is not just about language models but also includes applications in biology, physical sciences, IoT, robotics, and autonomous systems.|
|AI Regulation|AI should be regulated in specific use cases rather than as a broad field.|
||Existing regulations in various industries need to be extended to consider AI.|
|Future of Computing|NVIDIA GPUs are widely used because they're available on multiple platforms and can adapt to new AI architectures.|
|Education and AI|**Everybody in the world is now a programmer.** This is the miracle of AI. For the very first time, the technology divide has been completely closed. To engage with AI is a lot easier now than at any time in the history of computing.|
||The focus should shift from teaching everyone to code to creating technology that allows everyone to use AI without programming knowledge. The technology divide has been closed, allowing domain experts to utilize AI more easily.|
|Future Career Advice|Considering digital biology as a promising field, predicting it will transition from a field of science to a field of engineering.|
|Positive Outlook|We're going to enter an era of discovery and addressing current challenges through AI and engineering advancements.|


## Financial figures

* Early in the conversation, there's a mention of a very large figure: "how many gpus can we buy for 7 trillion" This seems to be a hypothetical question, possibly referring to a large investment or budget.

* When discussing the scale of computing infrastructure: "there's a about a trillion dollar worth of installed base of data centers around the world and over the course of the next four or five years we'll have $2 trillion do worth of data centers" This indicates the current and projected value of global data center infrastructure.

* When talking about the accessibility of supercomputers: "the cost of building purchasing a supercomputer today is really negligible" This suggests that the cost of high-performance computing has significantly decreased.

* In the context of AI infrastructure for developing nations: "it is not that cost it's not that it's not that costly it is also not that hard" Jensen Huang is emphasizing that building AI infrastructure is becoming more affordable and accessible.

* The discussion doesn't focus heavily on specific monetary values, but rather on the broader economic and technological implications of AI and accelerated computing.
